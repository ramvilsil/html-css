            An adult red knot is the second
            largest Calidris sandpiper, measuring 23–26 cm (9.1–10.2 in)
            long with a 47–53 cm (19–21 in) wingspan. The body shape is
            typical for the genus, with a small head and eyes, a short neck
            and a slightly tapering bill that is no longer than its head.[19]
            It has short dark legs and a medium thin dark bill. The winter, or
            basic, plumage becomes uniformly pale grey, and is similar between
            the sexes. The alternate, or breeding, plumage is mottled grey on t
            op with a cinnamon face, throat and breast and light-coloured rear
            belly. The alternate plumage of females is similar to that of the m
            ale except it is slightly lighter and the eye-line is less distinct.
            Canutus, islandica and piersmai are the "darker" subspecies. Subspecies r
            ogersi has a lighter belly than either roselaari or piersmai, and rufa is
            the lightest in overall plumage. The transition from alternate to basic
            plumages begins at the breeding site but is most pronounced during the southwards migration.
            The molt to alternate plumage begins just prior to the northwards migration
            to the breeding grounds, but is mostly during the migration period.[19]

            The large size, white wing bar and grey rump and tail make it easy
            to identify in flight. When feeding the short dark green legs give it a character
            istic 'low-slung' appearance. When foraging singly, they rarely call, but when fl
            ying in a flock they make a low monosyllabic knutt and when migrating they utter
            a disyllabic knuup-knuup. They breed in the moist tundra during June to August. T
            he display song of the male is a fluty poor-me. The display includes circling high
            with quivering wing beats and tumbling to the ground with the wings held upward. B
            oth sexes incubate the eggs, but the female leaves parental care to the male once
            the eggs have hatched.
